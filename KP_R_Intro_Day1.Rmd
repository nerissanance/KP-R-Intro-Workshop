# Part 1 - Introduction

### The basics: Navigating RStudio and Projects
Open RStudio! 

* Create a new project: File -> New Project
* Choose new directory or existing directory as preferred.
* Click "open in new session" to have multiple RStudio projects open.

A project's folder is automatically set as the working directory, which allows us to not worry about explicitly setting the working directory. This can be more convenient when working on the same code across different computers. I recommend always using a project to make your code not rely on being in a certain folder.

We can see recent projects by selecting File -> Recent Projects in the upper left corner of RStudio, or by clicking the list of recent projects in the upper right corner. If we click the name of the project it will switch to that project, or if we click the button it will open in a new session.

Easy Challenge: close your project and then re-open it.

# RStudio interface

When we start RStudio we have no files open by default. Click File -> New File -> RScript to start a new R script (or program). This is a text file with all of the R commands you want to run for an analysis.

As an alternative to an R script we can use a markdown file. R Markdown files combine R scripts with simple text formatting, which makes reports  (PDFs or HTMLs) easy to generate with embedded R output. If you don't already have R Markdown run `install.packages("markdown")` to install it. 

Try making a new R script and R markdown right now, and save the files. 

RStudio items to note:

* Files show up as tabs in the editor window, usually the upper left.
* The console is the R session where our commands are executed.
* Environment tab in the upper right, and history tab.
* Files tab in bottom right, plus plots, help, etc.
* We can click the "run" button to run the current R line in the editor.
* Code menu has a lot of commands and shortcuts.

# Basic R markdown file.

File -> New -> R Markdown

To write R code we need to start an R block with three backticks followed by r in braces (squiggly brackets - { and }). We can write commands inside of those brackets to change settings.

Task: everyone google "RMarkdown cheat sheet" and save that PDF. Make sure you're downloading version 2 (2016) rather than the 2015 version.

Challenge:

* Create a header line called "R Training Day 1", with size 1 (aka "header 1").
* Make a list (ordered or unordered) with three of your favorite animals.
* Write the equation: Area = Pi * r^2
* Compile as a PDF (or html if you prefer).

### Package installation
Many people write clever software that makes R smarter/better/faster/stronger. You can install packages by clicking the "Packages" tab in the bottom-right window, clicking install, and then searching for the package you wish to install.

Packages can also be installed through the command line using `install.packages()`. The package name must be wrapped in quotation marks so that R knows it is searching for that particular package named `"psych"`, rather than previously defined data named psych:

> It is generally good to keep RStudio and your packages up to date! Install the packages we will use in the workshop: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "knitr", "psych", "rmarkdown", "reshape2", "swirl"))
```

### The `library` function  
Anytime you want to utilize a previously installed package, you must retreive it with `library()` when you begin a new R session. You do not need to reinstall packages each time you quit and restart your R session. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(psych)
library(rmarkdown)
library(reshape2)
library(swirl)
# these packages can now be used in our RStudio session!
```

### Getting help  
The `?` symbol can be used to bring up the help pages:  
```{r}
?update.packages
?read.csv
?summary
?describe
?plot
?ggplot
?geometric.mean
```

### Variable assignment (`<-`)
Variables are special data structures that allow you to enter data into R. Objects are stored in R's memory and can be retrieved ("called") when you need them.  

You define objects through `variable assignment` and they are stored in your `global environment`.  

You define objects through variable assignment using the **assignment operator** `<-`. This is a "less than" `<` symbol immediately followed by a hyphen `-`

> You will also see that `=` is frequently used in place of the assignment operator. This works the same, but we recommend using the assignment operator for consistency. Arguments and functions frequently use `=` and it is best to consistently assign your variables with `<-` until you understand the basics.  

**Object definition/variable assignment requires three pieces of information**:  
1) object_name  
2) `<-`  
3) definition/assignment  

Let's define an object named `numeric_oject` and define it as the number 4:
```{r}
numeric_object <- 4

# the ls() function will show us what is in our global environment
ls()
```

### The R global environment
We now have an object defined in our global environment!

Objects in R are stored in your global environment. `ls()` will list previously defined objects in your environment.
```{r}
ls() # there is currently nothing in our global environment
```

"Call" (retrieve) the data contained wihtin the object by typing its name into your script and running the line of code
```{r}
numeric_object # 4 is returned
```

Let's try another example, this time using character data. Note that character data is **always** contained within quotation marks `" "` 
```{r}
welcome_object <- "Welcome"
ls()
```

We now have two objects in our global environment. Call the data contained within the object by typing its name and running the line of code:
```{r}
welcome_object
```

### Naming R variables  
Object names can be anything, but are always case sensitive. However, they cannot begin with a number and generally do not begin with symbols. However you choose to name your objects, be consistent and use brief descriptions of their contents.  

Names must be __**unique**__. If you resuse an old name, the old definition will be overwritten.  

Let's overwrite the object `welcome_object` from above.
```{r}
welcome_object <- "Welcome" 
```
See how the definition of `welcome_object` changed in your global environment window? However, there are still only two objects in your global environment. 

It also prints the new information when called:
```{r}
welcome_object
```

If we want to preserve the original object `welcome_object` we have to define a new object
```{r}
welcome_object2 <- "Welcome to Training Day 1"
ls() 
```

We now have three objects defined in our global environment! This third object contains new information and did not overwrite the old oblect:
```{r}
welcome_object2
```

### Variable classes (`class`)
Each variable in R has a `class` that summarizes the type of the data stored within the object. We will talk more about data types below.

> NOTE! "numeric" is the default data type for numbers in R:

```{r}
class(numeric_object) # this is numeric (NOT integer) data type!
class(welcome_object) # character type
class(welcome_object2) # character type
```

### Removing variables (`rm`)
We remove individual variables from our environment with `rm()`. For example, to remove `numeric_object`, we type:
```{r}
rm(numeric_object)
ls()
```
See how `numeric_object` disappeared from our global environment?

We can also wipe the entire environment with `rm(list = ls())` (or, click the broom icon in the upper right "global environment" pane)
```{r}
rm(list = ls()) 
ls()
```
Now, all objects are gone from our global environment.

### Vignettes
Double question marks ?? will lead you to coding walkthroughs called "vignettes". These usually come with preloaded data and examples:  
```{r}
??psych
```
You will often find that your questions are not answered by the help pages nor vignettes. In that case you should Google-search your question or error message along with the name of a free help website.  

For example, to get help making boxplots, I might Google search "R how to make boxplots stack overflow"

# **Challenge 1**
1. What is the three-piece recipe for variable definition? What piece goes where?  
2. Define two numeric variables.  
3. Define two character variables.  
4. How do you check what types of data these variables are?  
5. What does the `ls()` function do? Where else do you see this information?  
6. Remove one of your numeric and one of your character variables.  
7. Try to subract your remaining character variable from your numeric one. What happens? What might this tell you about data of different types?  
8. Wipe your environment clean.

```

# Atomic data types in R
Numeric, character, and logical (aka "boolean") data types all exist at the atomic level. Normally this means that they cannot be broken down any further and are the raw inputs for functions in R. Other R variables are frequently built upon these atomic types.

### Numeric type
Numeric data are numbers and integers. You may also hear numeric data referred to as `float` or `double` data types. By default, R stores everything as `doubles` (64 bit floating point numbers) which makes R very memory hungry. 

Define an object called `num` and then check its class
```{r}
num <- 2 * pi
num
class(num)
```

Standard mathematical operators apply to the creation of numeric data:
`+`   `-`   `*`   `^`   `**`  `/`  `%*% (matrix multiplication)`  `%/% (integer division)`  `%% (modular division)`
```{r}
5 + 2  
5 - 2  
5 * 2  
5 ^ 2  
5 ** 2 # same as ^  
5 / 2  
5 %/% 2  
5 %% 2  
5 %*% 2  
```

### Character type
Character (aka string or text) data are always contained within quotation marks `" "`. Character handling in R is fairly close to character handling in a Unix terminal.  

Let's create an object called `char` and define it with some character data. Then, check its class:
```{r}
char <- "This is character data"
char
class(char)
```

### Contatenating text (`paste`)
Use `paste()` to combine/concatenate character data. This will paste together separate words to larger texts. 
```{r}
char2 <- paste("Hey", "momma", "I'm", "a", "string")
char2
```

Blankspace is the default separater in the `paste()` function. If you don't want this and want the words to be smushed together, use the argument `sep = ""`
```{r}
char3 <- paste0("Hi", "momma", "I'm", "a", "string")
char3 
```
Note here that R is not a zero-indexed language - lists begin at the number 1. The one and only element in this object is the sentence "Hey momma I'm a string". 

Character data have some useful functions such as `grep`, `substr`, `strsplit`, and `gsub`. Use your help commands to learn more!  

### Function arguments
Arguments go inside of the parentheses of R functions. Unnamed arguments are things like the number 4. `split = " "` is what is called a named argument. This argument goes inside the parentheses of another function such as `strsplit`. 
```{r}
char4 <- "This/is/slash/separated/text"
char4
split1 <- strsplit(char4, split = "/")
split1 # a list is returned. 
```

Most functions require one or two arguments to be defined in order for it to properly run. You will find that functions are full of default, positional, and optional arguments that you can manipulate.  

### imple string subset example (`substr`)
`substr` lets you extract text from certain character positions in character data. Refer back to `char2`
```{r}
char2 <- paste("Hey", "momma", "I'm", "a", "string")
char2
```

If we want to extract just the first four characters of the `char2` object we type:
```{r}
substr(char2, start = 1, stop = 4)
```
"Hey " (Hey + blankspace) is returned.  

You can use `substr()` and the assignment operator `<-` to redefine the first four characters in `char2` with the word "Yes " followed by a blankspace
```{r}
substr(char2, 1, 4) <- "Yes "
char2 
```
What changed?  

### `gsub` example  
You can also substitute with `gsub()`. Let's say we want to substitute all periods `.` in `char2` with `X`. We would type:
```{r}
char2
gsub(".", "X", char2)
```
What happened here? R thinks `.` is a special shorthand for "everything".  

To be safe, put the period in brackets so that R views it as a subsetting operation and not "everything else". You will learn more about bracket notation during the subsetting portion in Part 2: 
```{r}
gsub("[.]", "X", char2)
```

Still nothing happened... Why not? (hint: we don't have any periods in our sentence!). Let's choose another letter:
```{r}
gsub("[m]", "X", char2)
# All "m" letters have now been replaced with "X". Remember that the `char2` object has not changed because we did not reassign it! 
char2 <- gsub("[m]", "X", char2)
char2
```

### Logical type  
Logical (boolean) data are dichotomous TRUE/FALSE values. R internally stores `FALSE` as 0 and `TRUE` as 1. Define a logical object:
```{r}
bool_object <- TRUE
bool_object
class(bool_object)
```
We recommend to always spell out `TRUE` and `FALSE` instead of abbreviating them `T` and `F` which might be mistaken for previously defined variables - therefore, you should not save anything as `T`, `F`, or `TRUE` or `FALSE`! Thus, there are certain words that do not make good variable names. R has many reserved words that you should avoid using. See `?reserved` for more information.

Note that logical data also take on numeric properties. Remember that `TRUE` is stored as the numeral 1 and `FALSE` is stored as 0. 
```{r}
bool_object + 1
TRUE - TRUE
TRUE + FALSE
FALSE - TRUE
```

### Logical tests  
Logical tests are helpful in R if you want to check for equivalence. Logical tests compare two objects and return a logical output. This is useful for removing missing data and subsetting (you will learn more about this in Part 2). Note the use of the double equals `==` sign. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"=="
?"&"
?"|"
?"!"
```
```{r}
TRUE == TRUE # is equivalent
FALSE == FALSE
TRUE == FALSE
TRUE & TRUE   # and 
TRUE | FALSE  # or
TRUE != FALSE  # not
TRUE > FALSE # greater than
FALSE >= TRUE # greater than or equal to
```

# **Challenge 2**
1. Define a numeric object as 0 and check its class.  
2. Define a boolean object as "FALSE" and check its class.  
3. Use `==` to compare your numeric and boolean object. Are they equivalent? Why or why not?  
4. Define a character object that uses `paste()` to combine more than one word into a sentence.  
5. Use `substr` to extract the first word of your sentence.  
6. Use `gsub` to replace a character in your sentence with some other character.  
```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

> See the below tables to help you remember your logical operations and functions.  

[Brunsdon and Comber 2015, page 15](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book241031) offer a useful summary table of logical operators in R. These are useful for comparing two data variables to each other:    

Logical operator | Description
---------------- | -----------
==               | Equal
!=               | Not equal
>                | Greater than
<                | Less than
>=               | Greater than or equal
<=               | Less than or equal
!                | Not (goes in front of other expressions) 
&                | And (combines expressions)
`|`              | Or (combines expressions)  

[Brunsdon and Comber 2015, page 102](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book241031) also offer an excellent summary table of logical functions in R.

Logical function | Description
---------------- | -----------
any(x)           | `TRUE` if any in a vector of conditions `x` is true
all(x)           | `TRUE` if all of a vector of conditions `x` is true
is.numeric(x)    | `TRUE` if `x` contains a numeric value
is.character(x)  | `TRUE` if `x` contains a character value
is.logical(x)    | `TRUE` if `x` contains a true or false value  

Often it is handy to see what types of data you are working with. Similar to `class()` we can see what data type an object is with `is.type`. A logical response is returned:
```{r}
is.numeric(num) 
is.logical(bool_object)

is.logical(char2)
class(char2)
```

### Data testing and type coercion (`as.type`)
"Type coercion" refers to changing the data from one type to another. You can change data types with `as.` and then the data type you wish to convert to.  
[Brunsdon and Comber 2015, page 102](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book241031) also offer an excellent summary table of data types in R.

Type        | Test          | Conversion
----------- | ------------- | ----------
character   | is.character  | as.character
complex     | is.complex    | as.complex
double      | is.double     | as.double
expression  | is.expression | as.expression
integer     | is.integer    | as.integer
list        | is.list       | as.list
logical     | is.logical    | as.logical
numeric     | is.numeric    | as.numeric
single      | is.single     | as.single
raw         | is.raw        | as.raw

### Type coercion example (`as.numeric`)  
```{r}
# Create some character data
char_data <- "9"
class(char_data)

# Coerce this character data to numeric data type
as.numeric(char_data)
class(char_data)
# What happened here? Why did `char_data` not change classes? (hint: we did not overwrite the object!)

char.data <- as.numeric(char_data)
class(char.data)
char.data
```

### Type coercion example 2 (`as.integer` and `L`)
You can change numeric type to integer type using `as.integer` and `L`
```{r}
num <- 4
class(num)

int <- as.integer(num)
class(int)

# or
int <- 2L
class(int)
```

Now, create some character data and try to convert it to integer type:
```{r}
# Create a new object
char.num <- "three"
char.num   #Note that the word three is contained within " " 
class(char.num)

# What happens if we try to coerce character to numeric data type? 
as.integer(char.num)
```
Why did this fail? Can R change character data to numbers? Why not? (hint: R has no protocol for automatically coerce words to numbers). As you can see, trying to coerce data types can lead to weird behavior sometimes. 

# **Challenge 3**
1. Create a character object and check its type using `is.character` and `class`. What is the difference between these two methods?    
2. Try to change ("coerce") this object to another data type using `as.integer`, `as.numeric`, or `as.logical`.  
3. Create an object of class "integer". Remember, there are two ways to do this!  
4. Why is 1 == "1" true?   Why is -1 < FALSE true?   Why is "one" < 2 false?  
```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

# Data structures
There are several kinds of data structures in R. Data structures are collections of data objects (e.g., numeric, character, and logical vectors, lists, and matrices) that work together. These four are the most common:  

1. vector  
2. list  
3. matrix  
4. dataframe  

### 3.1 Vector
A **VECTOR** is an ordered group of the same kind of data. "Ordered" means that their position matters. Vectors are one-dimensional and homogenous, and are thus referred to by their type (e.g., character vector, numeric vector, logical vector).  

Create a numeric vector by combining/concatenating elements with `c()`  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?c
```
```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(3, 5, 6, 5, 3)
numeric_vector
```
This numeric vector contains five elements.  

You can index a vector using square brackets (more on this in the subsetting section of Part 2). For example, to see what value lives in the third position of the object `numeric_vector`, you could type: 
```{r}
numeric_vector[3]
```

You can also add items to a vector using `c()` and a comma `,` (as long as it is the same data type)
```{r}
numeric_vector2 <- c(numeric_vector, 78)
numeric_vector2
```

It doesn't matter what the datatype is for a vector, as long as it is all the same
```{r}
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
logical_vector

logical_vector2 <- c(logical_vector, c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))
logical_vector2
```

You can also add and multiply vectors, but they need to be the same length
```{r}
logical_vector * logical_vector
```

What happens when we multiply `c(1,2,3,4) * c(TRUE, FALSE)` ? 
```{r}
c(1,2,3,4) * c(TRUE, FALSE)
```
Since the number of elements in the first vector (four) is a multiple of the length of the second vector (two), the second vector gets concatenated against itself two times. This is called "recycling".

### Generating random vectors (`seq`)
You might need to create vectors that are sequences of numbers. You can do this via `seq`. Here we specify a vector from zero to the `length` of our object `logical_vector2` (eight). The argument `by = 2` tells R that we want only the even numbers!
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?length
logical_vector2
length(logical_vector2)

seq(from=0,to=length(logical_vector2),by=2)
```

### Sequence where `by = 1` (`:`)
R also gives you a shorthand operator for creating sequences in whole number increments of 1. This is the colon symbol `:`
```{r}
0:8

sequence_object <- c(28:36)
sequence_object 

0:length(logical_vector2)
```

### `set.seed`    
You can also sample random groups of numbers. Use `set.seed()` to ensure that we all always get the same random draws from the parent universe, even on different machines
```{r}
?set.seed
?runif
?rnorm
?sample
```
Set the seed, and then choose our values:
```{r}
set.seed(1)

uniform <- runif(20, 3, 7) # 20 random samples from uniform distribution between the numbers 3 and 7
uniform

normal <- rnorm(20, 0, 1) # 20 random samples from the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
normal

integer <- sample(5:10, 20, replace = TRUE) # 20 random samples from between the numbers 5 and 10. Note that `replace=TRUE` signifies that it is OK to reuse numbers already selected.
integer

character <- sample(c("Cat", "Dog", "Pig"), 20, replace = TRUE) # 20 random samples of character data
character

logical <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 20, replace = TRUE) # 20 random samples of logical data
logical
```

### List
A **LIST** is an ordered group of data that are not of the same type. Lists are heterogenous. Instead of using `c()` like in vector creation, use `list()` to create a list:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?list

list1 <- list(TRUE, "one", 1) # include three kinds of data: logical, character, and integer
list1
class(list1)
```

Lists are simple containers and are not additive or multiplicative like vectors and matrices are:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
list1 * list(FALSE, "zero", 0) # Error
```

### Matrix  
**MATRICES** are homogenous like vectors. They are tables comprised of data all of the same type. Matrices are organized into rows and columns. 

Use `matrix()` to create a matrix
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?matrix
```
We can also specify how we want the matrix to be organized using the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments:
```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3) # this makes a 4 x 3 matrix
matrix1
class(matrix1)
```
We can also coerce a vector to a matrix, because a vector is comprised of homogenous data of the same kind, just like a matrix is:
```{r}
# Create a numeric vector from 1 to 20
vec1 <- c(1:20)
vec1
class(vec1)

# Coerce this vector to a matrix with 10 rows and 2 columns:
matrix2 <- matrix(vec1, ncol=2)
matrix2
class(matrix2)
```

### Data frame  
_**It is worth emphasizing the importance of data frames in R!**_ Inside R, a **DATA FRAME** is a list of equal-length vectors. These vectors can be of different types. Data frames are thus heterogenous like lists.  

This is simply a spreadsheet!  

Let's create a dataframe called `animals` using the vectors we already created:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
uniform
normal
integer
character
logical
```

We do this using `data.frame()`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?data.frame
```
```{r}
animals <- data.frame(uniform, normal, integer, character, logical, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# NOTE: `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` means that R will NOT try to interpret character data as factor type. More on this below. 
```

Take a peek at the `animals` data frame to see what it looks like:
```{r}
head(animals)
```

We can change the names of the columns by passing into it a vector with our desired names
```{r}
# Create a vector called `new_df_names` with the new column names:
new_df_names <- c("Weight", "Progress", "Height", "Type", "Healthy")

# Pass this vector into `colnames()`
colnames(animals) <- new_df_names
head(animals)
```

We can check the structure of our data frame via `str()`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?str
str(animals)
```
Here, we can see that a data frame is just a list of equal-length vectors! For readability purposes, `str()` displays columns from top to bottom, while the data are displayed left to right. 

##### Learning about your data frame  
```{r}
# View the dimensions (nrow x ncol) of the data frame:
dim(animals) 

# View column names:
colnames(animals)

# View row names (we did not change these, so they default to character type)
rownames(animals)
class(rownames(animals))
```

##### Change column order
You can change the order of the columns by specifying their new order using `c()` within what is called "bracket notation" `[ , ]`. 

> This will be covered with the rest of subsetting in Part 2. 

```{r}
animals <- animals[,c("Type", "Healthy", "Weight", "Height", "Progress")]
head(animals)
```

##### Factor data type  
Factor data are categorical types used to make comparisons between other data. Factors group the data by their "levels" (the different categorical groups within a factor).  

For example, in our `animals` dataframe, we can coerce "Type" from character to factor data type. Cat, Dog, and Pig are the factor levels. If we might want to compare heights and weights between Cat, Dog, and Pigs, we set the character "Type" vector to factor data type. We can do so with `factor()`.  

The dollar sign operator `$` is used to call a single vector from a data frame. This will be discussed more in Part 2 along with the rest of subsetting.
```{r}
# "Name" is character data type. See how each column name is preceded by `$`?
str(animals)   
 
animals$Type <- factor(animals$Type)
# "Name" is now factor data type!
str(animals)  

```

Notice that R stores factors internally as integers and uses the character strings as labels. Also notice that by default R orders factors alphabetically and returns them when we call the "Type" vector.
```{r}
animals$Type
levels(animals$Type)
```

##### Changing factor "levels"
Each animal type (Cat, Dog, and Pig) within the factor `animals$Type` vector are the factor levels. 

If we want to change how R stores the factor levels, we can specify their levels using the `levels()` argument. For example:
```{r}
animals$Type  # Levels: Cat Dog Pig (default alphabetical sort)
# What if we want to change the factor level sort to Levels: Dog Pig Cat?
animals$Type <- factor(animals$Type, levels = c("Dog", "Pig", "Cat"))
animals$Type # Now when we call animals$Name, we can see that the levels have changed
```

> NOTE: we will load the `animals` data frame from file at the beginning of Part 2, so do not worry if your dataframe does not look identical! 

# Saving your work (`write.csv`)  
It is always good to save your work. Saving a dataframe as a .CSV file is a convenient way to store it for future use. **Anything saved will be placed into your working directory!** 

See where your data frame is saved by typing: 
```{r}
getwd()
```

> NOTE: we will begin Part 2 with a discussion about how to check and set the working directory. The easiest way is to click "Session" --> "Set working directory" --> "Choose directory". Run `getwd()` again - did the file path change?  

The syntax looks like this:
`write.csv(object_name, file = "nameOfFile.csv", row.names = TRUE)`

# **Challenge 4**
1. Save the "animals" data frame as a .csv file named "animals.csv". 
2. How many basic arguments should you use to save using the `write.csv` function? 
```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```
Check your working directory to see if it worked!  


#Loading in csv and SAS data files
```{r loading}
#install.packages("rio")
library(rio)
?rio



animals <- read.csv("animals.csv", 
                    header = TRUE, 
                    stringsAsFactors = TRUE,
                    na.strings = " ")
animals
str(animals)
```
> Notice that `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`. If set to `TRUE`, R will try to guess which **character** vectors should automatically be converted to factors. This is problematic because 1) R is not always good at guessing and 2) R defaults to alphabetical and increasing numeric factor level sorting. This might not matter for your data, but it is recommended to set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` and manually convert your desired character vectors to factors. See the Part 1 help file to review these instructions.  

> `header = TRUE` will include the header row; `header = FALSE` will turn your header row into the first row of actual data. `na.strings = c(" ", 999)` indicates that blank cells and cells coded 999 allows you to specify data that should be automatically converted to `NA` upon importation. We do not have any here, so nothing is altered. 

# **Challenge 5**
1. Load the mammals "sleep_vim" dataset from the data folder using `read.csv` (what is shown is another way to load datasets that are included in R and packages). Save it in a variable named "Sleep_vim"
2. Remember what `ls()` does? What does `dir()` do? 
```{r}
library(VIM)
data(sleep)
sleep_vim = sleep
## YOUR CODE HERE
```
When dealing with Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx), you will find it more convenient to save them first as .csv files in Excel and then import them using `read.csv()`. However, you can also install the "foreign" package to load data from SPSS, Stata, Weka, Systat, Minitab, SAS, S, and MATLAB. See [this helpful rio documentation as well](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html). 


# **Challenge 6** Homework (optional)
swirl is a package that helps you learn R by using R. Visit the [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) homepage to learn more
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(swirl)
swirl()
# follow the instructions until you can select number 1 "R Programming: The basics of programming in R"
```

> NOTE: type `bye()` to exist swirl.
