Day 2 learning objectives:  
1. Set your working directory  
2. Loading data from files  
3. Subsetting in base R  
4. Missing data (NA)  
5. Merging data frames in dplyr  

# Loading data from files
Set your working directory to the R-Fundamentals data folder by clicking "Session" --> "Set working directory" --> "Choose directory". 

This is what a [hierarchical file system (Mac)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System) looks like:
![Hierarchical File System (Mac)](/Users/evan.admin/Desktop/R-Fundamentals/hfs.png)  

Load the animals dataset from the data folder inside the R-Fundamentals data folder. 
```{r, eval = F}
?read.csv
```
```{r}
animals <- read.csv("animals.csv", 
                    header = TRUE, 
                    stringsAsFactors = T,
                    na.strings = " ")
animals
str(animals)
```

> Notice that `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`. If set to `TRUE`, R will try to guess which **character** vectors should automatically be converted to factors. This is problematic because 1) R is not always good at guessing and 2) R defaults to alphabetical and increasing numeric factor level sorting. This might not matter for your data, but it is recommended to set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` and manually convert your desired character vectors to factors. See the Part 1 help file to review these instructions.  

> `header = TRUE` will include the header row; `header = FALSE` will turn your header row into the first row of actual data. `na.strings = c(" ", 999)` indicates that blank cells and cells coded 999 allows you to specify data that should be automatically converted to `NA` upon importation. We do not have any here, so nothing is altered. 

# **Challenge 1**
1. Load the mammals "sleep_VIM" dataset from the data folder using `read.csv` (what is shown is another way to load datasets that are included in R and packages). Save it in a variable named "Sleep_VIM"
2. Remember what `ls()` does? What does `dir()` do? 
```{r}
library(VIM)
data(sleep)
sleep_VIM = sleep
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

This dataset is part of the [VIM package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VIM/VIM.pdf). It looks at sleep patterns in various mammal species and contains missing (`NA`) values. Click  [here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/194/4266/732) to see the original research article. 

> NOTE: you DO NOT want to load the Student's Sleep Dataset from the "datasets" library. Your sleep dataset should have **62 rows and 10 columns**.  

When dealing with Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx), you will find it more convenient to save them first as .csv files in Excel and then import them using `read.csv()`. However, you can also install the "foreign" package to load data from SPSS, Stata, Weka, Systat, Minitab, SAS, S, and MATLAB. See [this helpful rio documentation as well](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html). 

# Inspecting the data frame
Remember from Part 1 that we can learn a lot about data in R. For dataframes, the following functions are useful:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(sleep_VIM)    # returns the structure of the dataframe
dim(sleep_VIM)    # dataframe dimensions; remember, we want 62 rows and 10 columns! 

rownames(sleep_VIM)   #row names (they have not been named and default to character type)

class(rownames(sleep_VIM)) # returns character type, even though they are numbers! 

nrow(sleep_VIM)   # number of rows
ncol(sleep_VIM)   # number of columns
unique(sleep_VIM)   # show rows with unique data

head(sleep_VIM, n = 10) # show the first "n" rows
tail(sleep_VIM, n = 4) # show the last "n" rows
```

`names()` and `colnames()` both return column names of the data frame:
```{r}
names(sleep_VIM)  
colnames(sleep_VIM)
```

# Subsetting in base R
Efficiently subsetting your data will save you time and stress. Fortunately, there are several different ways to subset data in base R.

### Subsetting in base R (`$`)
Remember from Part 1 that the dollar sign operator `$` will extract only a single vector/column within the data frame:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"$" # Remember to wrap symbols in quotation marks to view their help pages
```
```{r}
sleep_VIM$Dream #Returns only the "Dream" vector from the `sleep_VIM` data frame.
```

> Type sleep_VIM$ and press the TAB key - a handy list of the columns in your data will appear! 

```{r, eval = F}
sleep_VIM$
```

# **Challenge 2**
1. Practice extracting a few variables from the `animals` dataframe using the dollar sign `$`
2. Plot them in a histogram using the `hist()` function. How do you do this? 
3. Can all data types be visualized with histograms? Why or why not?
```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

### Subsetting in two dimensions with bracket notation `[ , ]` 
However, we do not have to specify all rows or columns when subsetting with bracket notation. We can specify dimensions of both rows and columns that we want. You might find subsetting using **bracket notation** `[ , ]` along with variable names, positive and negative integers, and/or logical values is easier because you can subset multiple elements at once.  

> Inside the brackets, everything before the comma refers to rows. Everything after the comma refers to columns! 

> [rows , columns]  

Let's start just with the columns!  

### Variable names (`[ , c("Variable Names")]`)
You can subset your data by specifying variable names within bracket notation and using the `c()` function to create a column name character vector of names you want to keep.

We can create a new dataframe object `sleep_varnames` that includes only "BodyWgt" and "BrainWgt" variable names from the `sleep` data frame:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"["
```
```{r}
sleep_varnames <- sleep_VIM[ , c("BodyWgt", "BrainWgt")]
str(sleep_varnames)
head(sleep_varnames)

# compare this to "sleep_VIM", which remains unchanged!
sleep_VIM
```

> Notice that the comma is still included within the bracket notation before the vector of column names. This indicates that we want ALL of the rows corresponding to these two columns. This is the same when we only want to subset rows and include ALL columns (see below).  

##### Remember that in bracket notation `[ , ]` everything **before** the comma refers to rows, and everything **after** the comma refers to columns!

### Subsetting with positive integers `[ , c()]`
Subsetting by **positive** integers works as well. This will **include** only the specified columns as referenced by their indicies - we do not have to type out their names!  

Create an object `sleep_posint` that includes only "NonD", "Sleep", and "Exp" columns.  

First use `str()` or `colnames` to see which integer values these columns represent. Because we only want the 3rd, 5th, and 9th columns, we type:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(sleep_VIM)
sleep_posint <- sleep_VIM[ , c(3, 5, 9)] # why does our vector go after the comma?
str(sleep_posint)
head(sleep_posint)
```

### Subsetting with negative integers `[ , -c()]`
Subsetting by **negative** integers will **exclude** the specified columns. Notice the `-` symbol before `c()` inside our bracket notation.

We can create an object called `sleep_negint` that includes everything **except** columns 1 and 2 ("BodyWgt" and "BrainWgt"):
```{r}
str(sleep_VIM)
sleep_negint_VIM <- sleep_VIM[ , -c(1, 2)]
str(sleep_negint_VIM)
head(sleep_negint_VIM, n = 3)
```

### Subsetting with logical tests
We can also use logical tests to subset our data. For example, what if we want to include only the _**rows**_ that have a value of 4 for "Exp"? We can use the relational operator `==`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"=="
```
```{r}
sleep_logical <- sleep_VIM[sleep_VIM$Exp == 4 , 8:10 ] # why is the comma included? 
sleep_logical
```
Only rows with values of 4 for "Exp" are returned! 

What if we want to subset the data so it includes only the rows where "Exp" equals 1 **_and_** "Danger" is equal to 2? We would use the "and" `&` logical operator.  

What if we want to include rows where "Exp" is equal to 1 **_or_** "Danger" is equal to 2? We would use the "or" `|` logical operator: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"&"
?"|"
```
```{r}
# & (and) = all conditions must be TRUE
sleep_logical_and <- sleep_VIM[sleep_VIM$Exp == 1 & sleep_VIM$Danger == 2, ] 
sleep_logical_and

# | (or) = just one of the conditions must be TRUE
sleep_logical_or <- sleep_VIM[sleep_VIM$Exp == 1 | sleep_VIM$Danger == 2, ]
sleep_logical_or

dim(sleep_logical_and) # 5 rows x 10 columns
dim(sleep_logical_or) # 36 rows x 10 columns
```

In `sleep_logical_and`, "Exp" must equal 1 _and_ "Danger" must equal 2 to be included - both conditions must be TRUE.  

In `sleep_logical_or`, "Exp" must equal 1 _or_ "Danger" can equal 2 to be included - only one of these two conditions must be TRUE, hence the greater number of rows returned by "or".  

### Subsetting lists with double bracket notation `[[ ]]`
You can also subset lists. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"[["
```
Create an examlpe list:
```{r}
example_list <- list(TRUE, "string data", 5)
example_list
```

> Consider the analogy of going through airport security. When you place your shoes in the plastic bin and then place it on the conveyor belt, you have placed two things: 1) your shoes inside the 2) plastic bin. 

Use single brackets `[]` retrieves _both the placeholder and its value (the bin and your shoes)_ 
```{r}
example_list[1]
```

However, double brackets go one layer deeper inside the plastic bin and return _only your shoes!_ 
```{r}
example_list[[1]]
```

# **Challenge 3**
1. Load the `iris` dataset! Type `data(iris)` to load it.  
2. What is this dataset? How do you find out?  
3. Subset the `iris` dataset in three ways using column names and positive and negative integers.  
4. Subset `iris` using logical tests, `&`, and `|`    
```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

# Missing data (`NA`)
Identifying missing data can be important for subsetting purposes. R codes missing values as `NA`. Identifying missing data is important because dealing with it might be necessary to run basic tests like `mean()`. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?NA
?mean # Scroll down to `na.rm`
```
```{r}
mean(sleep_VIM$NonD) # This returns NA because R is unsure how to deal with NA cells for the `mean` computation.
```

Look at the "Usage" portion of the help file - we know what `rm` is, and we now know what `NA` is, so what do you think the logical argument `na.rm =` will do? That's right! We can use `na.rm = TRUE` to properly calculate the mean of the NonD column by now excluding the NAs. 
```{r}
mean(sleep_VIM$NonD, na.rm = TRUE) #Now `mean()` returns the mean!
```

While `na.rm()` nor `str()` will not tell us which data are missing in a convenient way, `is.na()` does. Wrap the name of your data frame in `is.na()` to return logical values. Missing data is coded as `TRUE`, while present data are coded as `FALSE`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?is.na
sum(is.na(sleep_VIM))
```

People code data in very strange ways besides `NA`, so don't be surprised if you see some other signifier. But, whatever you do, do not use the number zero! 

## Missing data (`NA`) - recoding missing data
Make a copy of `sleep_VIM` named sv so we do not alter the original, then recode NA values in place to say "NONE":
```{r}
sv <- sleep_VIM

sv[is.na(sv)] <- "PIZZA"
sv
```

They now say `NONE`.

However, for R to handle them correctly, we want to recode them to say `NA`. We can do this with a combination of the name of our data set, bracket notation, our relational operator `==` and our old friend the assignment operator `<-` ! Can we still use the `is.na` function? Why or why not?  
```{r}
sv[sv == "PIZZA"] <- NA
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sv
```

> NOTE: here `<NA>` and `NA` are virtually synonymous and R will treat them both as missing.  

We can also subset only rows without any missing data using bracket notation. `complete.cases()` will find rows with no missing values.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?complete.cases
```
```{r}
s_complete <- sleep_VIM[complete.cases(sleep_VIM) , ]  
s_complete
```

Remember to include the comma here to tell R you want ALL of the columns for these rows :) 
Then, test it to see if it contains missing values. All cells are `FALSE`
```{r,eval=FALSE}
is.na(s_complete)
sum(is.na(s_complete)) # what did we do here?
```

Conversely, we can subset the sleep_VIM data to include only rows with missing data by adding the logical bash operator `!` (not). 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"!"
```
```{r}
s_NA <- sleep_VIM[!complete.cases(sleep_VIM),]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
s_NA # All rows have at least one cell with missing data
is.na(s_NA) # We see TRUE values where data is missing
sum(is.na(s_NA)) # 38 cells have missing data

# Do the number of missing cases in s_NA equal that to the whole data set? 
sum(is.na(s_NA)) == sum(is.na(sleep_VIM)) # ... yes! Both data objects contain 38 NA values! 
```

# Subset with `subset`
`subset` can also be used to subset your data. How do you use the help (hint `?subset`) to see what the `x`, `subset`, and `select` arguments do?For example:
```{r, eval = F}
?subset
```
```{r}
# subset rows where "BrainWgt" is less than 5 and "Danger" equals 4 and "Exp" equals 3:
subset_1 <- subset(x = sleep_VIM, 
                   subset = BrainWgt < 60 & Danger == 4 & Exp == 3,
                   select = c("Sleep", "Span"))
subset_1

# or

# subset all rows where BrainWgt is less than 100 or Danger equals 4 along with the "BrainWgt", "Danger", and "Exp" columns:
subset_2 <- subset(sleep_VIM, BrainWgt < 100 | Danger == 4, select = c(BrainWgt, Danger, Exp))
subset_2
```

# **Challenge 4**
Subset the `animals` dataframe:  
1. in one dimension.  
2. in two dimensions using either bracket notation `[ , ]` or `subset`.  
3. using logical tests.  
```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

# Merging data with `merge`
Merging data is useful when we want to combine two different dataframes that share a vector/column. We "merge" by that column. The first two arguments in `merge()` are the names of the two data frames, followed by `by` where we tell which column names we want to match.  

Also note this shorthand way for creating a dataframe. For example: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?merge
```
```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(Name = c("Joe", "Susan", "Jack", "Kelly"),
                  City = c("Berkeley", "Berkeley", "Oakland", "Oakland"),
                  Math = c(42, 48, 50, 46),
                  Reading = c(8, 10, 10, 10))
df1

df2 <- data.frame(Name = c("Joe", "Susan", "Jack", "Kelly"),
                    Science = c(99, 100, 99, 100),
                    Music = c(19, 18, 20, 20),
                    Art = c(20, 20, 19, 18))
df2

df_merge <- merge(df1, df2, by = "Name")
df_merge
#What happened here? 
```

### Merging data - `cbind()` and `rbind()`
Other useful functions include `cbind()` and `rbind()`.  

`cbind()` will bind two data frames by their columns. Let's cbind `df1` and a new dataframe, `df3`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?cbind
?rbind # Click the "Combine R Objects by Rows or Columns" link
```
```{r}
df1

df3 <- data.frame(Name = c("Heather", "Billy", "Hector", "Jane"),
                  City = c("San Francisco", "Los Angeles", "San Francisco", "Chico"),
                  Math = c(49, 44),
                  Reading = c(10,10))
df3

df_cbind <- cbind(df1, df3)
df_cbind
```
> NOTE: cbind will not warn you if you have duplicate column names! 

`rbind()` will add more rows to an existing data frame. An example:
```{r}
df1 

dfB <- data.frame(Name = c("James", "Tanisha", "Elizabeth", "Barack"),
                  City = c("Cleveland", "Memphis", "Detroit", "Chicago"),
                  Math = c(44, 49, 50, 49),
                  Reading = c(9, 9, 9, 10))
df_rbind <- rbind(df1, dfB)
df_rbind
```
> NOTE: for rbind to work, you should have the same column names for both of your data frames! 

# **Challenge 5** 
1. Using the "animals" data frame, create a subsetted data frame called `cats_dogs` that contains only cats and dogs. (hint: does "and" actually mean "and" here?)  
2. Create a subsetted data frame that only contains healthy pigs! (hint: what is the meaning of "and" here in contrast to question #1?)  
3. load the `mtcars` dataset. How might you find out what it is and how do you load it?  
4. subset `mtcars` in five different ways.  
```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE
```

You can also order your data using `order`. For example, sort `mtcars` by ascending cyl and descending mpg: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
new_cars <- mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl, -mtcars$mpg),] 
new_cars
```
 
# Reshaping your data
You will probably find that certain plotting and testing functions require that the data be formatted in "long" or "wide" format. The "reshape2" R package offers a handy way to reformat your data. 

In base R, `t` will quickly transpose your dataframe or matrix. The rows will become the columns, and the columns will become the rows:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?t
```
```{r}
mat1 <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
mat1
mat1_t <- t(mat1)
mat1_t

# or

animals_t <- t(animals)
animals_t
```
