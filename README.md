# KP-R-Intro-Workshop

Welcome to the KP DOR R fundamentals training! 

We are developing this training in response to the need to improve support and guidance to programmers at DOR interested in learning the R programming language.

This training consists of three two-hour sessions, and by the end of it we hope that you will be able to do the following: 
<br/> <br/>
*Part 1: Connecting and base R*
- create a project in RStudio
- create an Rmd file
- download, install packages and read them into your library
- find, read, and understand help files and other key documentation (eg. cran)
- save and restore projects 
- understand the basic types of data
- load a csv file and SAS file into the environment
 <br/> <br/>

*Part 2: Manipulating and summarizing data*
- employ basic data manipulation techniques
- understand missing data in R 
- produce descriptive/summary statistics
<br/> <br/>

*Part 3: Data visualization and analysis*
- graph with base r and ggplot
- run statistical tests
- run regression models

Materials for this training were created/compiled by Nerissa Nance with some help from Chris Kennedy. Source materials come mostly from the DLab R Fundamentals training (accessed here[https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals]).
